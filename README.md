# BANK LOAN DATA ANALYSIS
This project involves developing a comprehensive bank loan report using Power BI, designed to provide insights into lending performance and risk management.
The report consists of three interactive dashboards:
-	Summary Dashboard
-	Overview Dashboard
-	Detail Dashboard

These dashboards deliver actionable insights into lending activities, key performance indicators (KPIs), and trends, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions.
